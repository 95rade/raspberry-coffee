## Servos and Sun, Sunflower and Multiplexer

This is an illustration of 2 things:
- The [`SunFlower`](../SunFlower/README.md) project, that orients a panel (like a Solar Panel) so it faces the Sun
- The [`NMEA.multiplexer`](../NMEA.multiplexer/README.md) project, that can deal with an NMEA feed.

The goal is to have a small device (featured later), carried by some vehicle on the go (a car, RV, boat...), constantly facing the Sun (during the day... of course!)
