## Jupyter Notebooks
Not only for Python!

Install it on the Raspberry Pi:
```
 $ sudo pip3 install jupyter
```

Works also for Java.

See 
- https://blog.frankel.ch/teaching-java-jupyter-notebooks/
- https://hub.mybinder.org/user/spencerpark-ijava-binder-ey9zwplq/notebooks/3rdPartyDependency.ipynb

Will provide examples as notebooks, for the features presented in this project.

From this directory, just run
```
 $ jupyter notebook
```
And from a browser any where on the network of the Raspberry Pi, `raspberry-pi` being the name or address of the Raspberry Pi where the notebook server is running, reach `http://raspberry-pi:8888/tree` to start playing!
 
Come back here soon.
