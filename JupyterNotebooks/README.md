## [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), for Java
Emergence of AI and Deep Learning contributed to the popularity of the Jupyter Notebooks.

Not only for Python, also supports many languages!
The main requirement being to have a REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop).

Java 9 comes with a REPL (called `JShell`).

To install Java 9 on the Raspberry Pi, see [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=200232). 
> Note: Some restrictions may apply, the Raspberry Pi Zero might not like it.

Install Jupyter on the Raspberry Pi:
```
 $ sudo pip3 install jupyter
```

Works also for Java.

### Raspberry-Coffee Notebooks

Will provide examples as notebooks, for the features presented in this project.

From this directory, just run
```
 $ jupyter notebook
```
And from a browser any where on the network of the Raspberry Pi, `raspberry-pi` being the name or address of the Raspberry Pi where the notebook server is running, reach `http://raspberry-pi:8888/tree` to start playing!
 
Come back here soon.
