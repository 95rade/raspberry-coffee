## Close to production!
This project is the one to run to have the features you are interested in also available from a Web UI.

Pick and choose your features in other modules, grab the web ages you need, modify the `index.html`, etc, and
run the script `to.prod.sh` to package everything.

It pulls the `NMEA.multiplexer` and the `NMEA.mux.extensions` projects.
This is what you would to tweak to fit your requirements.

## Warning!
This project directory is a play ground, again, it is here for you to compose your own server!
