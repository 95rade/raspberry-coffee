## Close to production!
This project is the one to run to have the features you are interested in also available from a Web UI.

It pulls the `NMEA.multiplexer` and the `NMEA.mux.extensions` projects.
This is what you would to tweak to fit your requirements.

## WIP!
### TODO
- The `web` folder...
- the `to.prod.sh` script.
- etc...
