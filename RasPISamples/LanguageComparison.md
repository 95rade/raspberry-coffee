## Comparing several programming languages

### The problem to solve
We want to solve a system of `n` equations, with `n` unknowns.

This problem implies recursive algorithms.
Object oriented languages are not a requirement.
Functionnal programming is not a requirement.

The idea here is to be able to compare the code corresponding to each language, addressing the exact same problem,
and - hopefully - returning the same result.

Comparing the length of the code, its readability, it complexity, and possibily its beauty
can be an interesting exercise.

We will use the following programming languages:
- [Java](#java)
- [Scala](#scala)
- [Kotlin](#kotlin)
- [JavaScript](#javascript)
- [Python](#python)
- [C](#c)

#### Output
All versions of the program pretty much return the same output, like
```
 Solving:
 (12.000000 x A) + (13.000000 x B) + (14.000000 x C) = 234.000000
 (1.345000 x A) + (-654.000000 x B) + (0.001000 x C) = 98.870000
 (23.090000 x A) + (5.300000 x B) + (-12.340000 x C) = 9.876000

 Done is 114,307 nano(â„«) sec.
 A = 6.488222
 B = -0.137817
 C = 11.280925
```

#### Compilation
Java, Scala and Kotlin require a compilation. C too, but not from Gradle.

Run
```
 $ ../gradlew shadowJar
```

#### Java
The sources are in [`src/java/raspisamples/matrix`](./src/java/raspisamples/matrix).
(See also [this document](./src/java/raspisamples/smoothing/README.md) ).

To run it:
```
 $ java -cp ./build/libs/RasPISamples-1.0-all.jar raspisamples.matrix.SystemUtil
```

#### Scala
The sources are in [`src/scala/systems`](./src/scala/systems).

To run it:
```
 $ scala -cp ./build/libs/RasPISamples-1.0-all.jar systems.SystemUtils
```

#### Kotlin
The sources are in [`src/kotlin/KtSystemSolver.kt`](./src/kotlin).

```
 $ java -cp ./build/libs/RasPISamples-1.0-all.jar systemsKt.KtSystemSolverKt
```
or
```
 $ kotlin -classpath ./build/libs/RasPISamples-1.0-all.jar systemsKt.KtSystemSolverKt
```


#### JavaScript
See the sources - and more - in the [`smoothing/js`](./smoothing/js) folder, file `matrix.js`.

From `node.js`:
```
 $ cd smoothing/js
 $ node matrix.js from-node
```

Or just load `smoothing.spray.html` in a browser.

#### Python
Sources are in [`src/python/system.py`](./src/python).

To run it:
```
 $ cd src/python
 $ python system.py
```

#### C
Sources are in [`src/C/system.c`](./src/C).

To compile and run (the compilation is not done by Gradle, and may vary depending on your system):
```
 $ cd src/C
 $ gcc -lm -o system system.c
 $ ./system
```
