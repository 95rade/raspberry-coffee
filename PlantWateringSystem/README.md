# WIP: Plant Watering System
We want to interface a Moisture/Humidity/Temperature sensor (https://www.adafruit.com/product/1298) with
a solenoid valve (https://www.adafruit.com/product/997), to irrigate the plants in need.

We start from an Arduino sketch, that can read the STH10. The 10KOhms resistor is not to be forgotten.
