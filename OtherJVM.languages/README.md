# Groovy on Pi
This is a small Groovy project that shows how to use Java classes written for the `Raspberry PI`
from a Groovy script.

Groovy is similar to Scala in the sense that
* It runs on a JVM
* It knows what a `.class` file is, whatever language it has been compiled from.

Those interested will also take a look at the Java part of the project, showing how to invoke scripting languages (Groovy, JavaScript) from Java,
using the features of the JSR223. Do check it out, it's worth it.
