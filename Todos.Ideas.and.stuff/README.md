## Minimal UI

#### How many buttons?

User interaction(s) can be
- Click
- Double click
- Long click
- Two-button click (or more..., Shft, Ctrl, etc). Can generate Shift+DoubleClick, and all kinds of such combinations...
- ... and what else?

Functions
- Back
- Up
- Select
- Down

Those functions above can be performed by 4 distinct buttons, or just 2, `Button1` and `Button2`:
- Back: Single Click on `Button1`
- Up: Single Click on `Button2`
- Select: Double Click on `Button2`
- Down: Long Click on `Button2`

We even have room available for operations triggered by:
- Double Click on `Button1`
- Long Click on `Button1`
- `Button1` pressed and Single Click on `Button2`
- `Button1` pressed and Double Click on `Button2`
- `Button1` pressed and Long Click on `Button2`
