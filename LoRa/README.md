# LoRa (Long Range)
Shows how to use an RFM95W Lora Radio module

This  board has a SPI interface, the code in this directory could belong to the `I2C.SPI` project, but the intention was to also provide the code for the Arduino Uno.

I found the code I started from on the [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3072) web site.

The two sketches require the same wiring:

You need two Arduinos: one to transmit, one to receive.

## Next
The same, on a Raspberry PI, in Java.
